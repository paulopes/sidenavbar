# sidenavbar

### Simple vanilla js replacement for Bootstrap's collapsed navbar

This implementation shows the navbar items (when the navbar is collapsed) inside a sidebar that slides in from the right side of the page, instead of unfolding from the top of the page.

It requires that the navbar's nav element has a "sidenavbar" class instead of a "navbar-expand-xx" class.

Like bootstrap's collapsing method, it is also necessary that each navbar-item be inside of a div that has the "navbar-collapse" class.
